// pointers useful notations

int i = 10;
int j = 20;
int *p1;
int *p2;
p1 = &i;
p2 = &j;
if (*p1 == *p2) { ... } // Check whether the referenced values are the same even if they are placed in different position within the system memory
if (p1 == p2) { ... } // Check whether the two pointers refer to the same object, i.e., they store the same memory address
if (p1 > p2) { ... } // Check whether the address p1 comes after the address p2 into the system memory; this is often meaninglessIf p1==p2 also *p1==*p2
